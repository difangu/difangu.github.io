# World Happiness Report 2019
CS-498-Data-Visualization

In this final project, we will take the journey to look at The World Happiness Report 2019. Here is a brief official overview of World Happiness Report: 
"The World Happiness Report is a landmark survey of the state of global happiness that ranks 156 countries by how happy their citizens perceive themselves to be. This yearâ€™s World Happiness Report focuses on happiness and the community: how happiness has evolved over the past dozen years, with a focus on the technologies, social norms, conflicts and government policies that have driven those changes."

## Messaging. 
Throughout the interactive slideshows I built, I tried to convey the message there are some correlationship between happiness score and factors associated with each country. It's not necessarily causation, but there seems to be some strong assciation. For example, happier countries tend to have higher GDP per Capita, and it seems to have a more compact cluster among the happiest countries. However, for the least happy countries, they tend to have looser correlationship between factors and happiness score.

## Narrative Structure. 
I used interactive slideshow to deliver the message. Users are allowed to interact in each slide. For example, on the index page, users can hover their mouse over six factors to explore the definition for each of them; on the bar chart and scatter plots, users can turn off some bars to focus on one or two of them. Hovering over some objects such as bars and cricles will also pop up the tooltip to provide more detailed information about each observation, in this case, country. 

## Visual Structure. 
What visual structure is used for each scene? How does it ensure the viewer can understand the data and navigate the scene? How does it highlight to urge the viewer to focus on the important parts of the data in each scene? How does it help the viewer transition to other scenes, to understand how the data connects to the data in other scenes?
Scenes. What are the scenes of your narrative visualization? How are the scenes ordered, and why

Consistent visual structure has been applied across each scene. All fonts are rendered in Font Georgia. Font size, background color, font color and line height also remain constant across each scene. The visual structure follows text-to-plot structure allowing our audiences to read the purpose of the scene first. So they are able to have a rough intuition what they are going to observe and what ideas they are about to receive. Then they can explore each plot by themselves either exploring the visualization freely or reading some hints from the annotations. 
Arrow buttons have been added on each page in order to help our audiences navigate from the start of the scenes to the last scene. I intentionally did not allow users to jump the scenes because order is particularly important in the interative slideshow. 

The order of the slide show follow from the easy to the hardest and high-level to detailed. Bar plot gives an overview about the average of each group. Then the first 3-D scatter plot demonstrates the correlationship between group type vs. happiness score vs. factor. Then the second 4-D scatter plot demonstrates the correlationship between group type vs. two factors vs. happiness score. 

## Annotations. 
Annotations have been attached in three plots in order to provide helpful information and broanden audience's insight. Annotations are designed in gray color with certain degree of opacity. In this way, annotations will attract sufficient attention without disturbing the overall visual structure of each plot. All of annotations will not disappear or change in a single scene in order to maintain high visual consistency via different scenes. For example, in the scatter plots, annotations will point out the unique distribution among three happiness group. While the bar chart will point out the similar different between average score of two consecutive group in order. 

## Parameters. 
What are the parameters of the narrative visualization? What are the states of the narrative visualization? How are the parameters used to define the state and each scene?

## Triggers. 
What are the triggers that connect user actions to changes of state in the narrative visualization? What affordances are provided to the user to communicate to them what options are available to them in the narrative visualization?
